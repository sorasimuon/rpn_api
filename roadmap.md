# ROADMAP

- [ENH] As a developper, I want to extend tests coverage to all functions (only check input format are tested so far)
- [ENH] As a user, I want to perform other computation and not just basic arithmetic operations
- [ENH] As a developper, I want to refactor the calculate function in order to support other type of calculation in the future
- [ENH] As a user, I want to remove the last number added to a stack

Long term (and only if necessary for scalability and if there is a demand for it):
- [ENH] As a user, I want to be able to save the stacks so I can go back to them even if the service restart
- [ENH] As a user, I want a registered user access
- [ENH] As a developper, I want to pre cache the stacks in case there are too many and very large stacks in DB
