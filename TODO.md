# TO DO

To complete the RPN api, we can:

- The function calculate must be improved in order to enable other types of calculation (for basic +, -, \*, /, it is fine)
- Extend the test coverage to all functions (only basic functions have been covered so far)
- Code refacto : the entire code (except the test file) is in app.py. We could for example separate endpoints related to stack functions (create new stack, delete, get one, list all ...) from those for operations on a stack (add a value, apply an operation
- Add more comments in the code
